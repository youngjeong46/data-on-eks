It’s enabled by default with Amazon EMR on EKS. It helps run Spark workloads faster, leading to lower running costs. It includes multiple performance optimization features, such as Adaptive Query Execution (AQE), dynamic partition pruning, flattening scalar subqueries, bloom filter join, and more.  In addition to the cost benefit brought by the EMR runtime for Spark, Amazon EMR on EKS can take advantage of other AWS features to further optimize cost. For example, you can run Amazon EMR on EKS jobs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances, providing up to 90% cost savings when compared to On-Demand Instances. Also, Amazon EMR on EKS supports Arm-based Graviton EC2 instances, which creates a 15% performance improvement and up to 30% cost savings when compared a Graviton2-based M6g to M5 instance type.  The recent graceful executor decommissioning feature makes Amazon EMR on EKS workloads more robust by enabling Spark to anticipate Spot Instance interruptions. Without the need to recompute or rerun impacted Spark jobs, Amazon EMR on EKS can further reduce job costs via critical stability and performance improvements.  Additionally, through container technology, Amazon EMR on EKS offers more options to debug and monitor Spark jobs. For example, you can choose Spark History Server, Amazon CloudWatch, or Amazon Managed Prometheus and Amazon Managed Grafana (for more details, refer to the Monitoring and Logging workshop). Optionally, you can use familiar command line tools such as kubectl to interact with a job processing environment and observe Spark jobs in real time, which provides a fail-fast and productive development experience.  Amazon EMR on EKS supports multi-tenant needs and offers application-level security control via a job execution role. It enables seamless integrations to other AWS native services without a key-pair set up in Amazon EKS. The simplified security design can reduce your engineering overhead and lower the risk of data breach. Furthermore, Amazon EMR on EKS handles security and performance patches so you can focus on building your applications.

The solution uses unmodified TPC-DS data schema and table relationships, but derives queries from TPC-DS to support the Spark SQL test case. It is not comparable to other published TPC-DS benchmark results.  Key concepts Transaction Processing Performance Council-Decision Support (TPC-DS) is a decision support benchmark that is used to evaluate the analytical performance of big data technologies. Our test data is a TPC-DS compliant dataset based on the TPC-DS Standard Specification, Revision 2.4 document, which outlines the business model and data schema, relationship, and more. As the whitepaper illustrates, the test data contains 7 fact tables and 17 dimension tables, with an average of 18 columns. The schema consists of essential retailer business information, such as customer, order, and item data for the classic sales channels: store, catalog, and internet. This source data is designed to represent real-world business scenarios with common data skews, such as seasonal sales and frequent names. Additionally, the TPC-DS benchmark offers a set of discrete scaling points (scale factors) based on the approximate size of the raw data. In our test, we chose the 3 TB scale factor, which produces 17.7 billion records, approximately 924 GB compressed data in Parquet file format.  Test approach A single test session consists of 104 Spark SQL queries that were run sequentially. To get a fair comparison, each session of different deployment types, such as Amazon EMR on EKS, was run three times. The average runtime per query from these three iterations is what we analyze and discuss in this post. Most importantly, it derives two summarized metrics to represent our Spark performance:  Total execution time – The sum of the average runtime from three iterations Geomean – The geometric mean of the average runtime Test results In the test result summary (see the following figure), we discovered that the Amazon EMR-optimized Spark runtime used by Amazon EMR on EKS is approximately 2.1 times better than the open-source Spark on Amazon EKS in geometric mean and 3.5 times faster by the total runtime.    The following figure breaks down the performance summary by queries. We observed that EMR runtime for Spark was faster in every query compared to open-source Spark. Query q67 was the longest query in the performance test. The average runtime with open-source Spark was 1019.09 seconds. However, it took 150.02 seconds with Amazon EMR on EKS, which is 6.8 times faster. The highest performance gain in these long-running queries was q72—319.70 seconds (open-source Spark) vs. 26.86 seconds (Amazon EMR on EKS), a 11.9 times improvement.

These best practices will cover various aspects, including cluster configuration, resource management, data storage, security, monitoring, and more. By following these recommended practices, you can optimize the performance, reliability, and security of your data and ML workloads on EKS. Stay tuned for valuable insights and guidance on how to achieve the best outcomes in your EKS environment. Through working with AWS customers, we’ve identified a number of Best Practices that we have recommended for Spark or other large data workloads. We continue to collect and post those recommendations here. Because this is an ongoing effort, please open an Issue or Pull Request if you find something outdated so we can update it. These Data on EKS Best Practices are meant to expand upon the EKS Best Practices Guide for data-centric use cases (e.g., batch processing, stream processing, and machine learning) and we recommend reviewing the EKS Best Practices as a primer before diving into these. The Data on EKS Best Practices are not comprehensive and we recommend you read through the guidance and determine what’s best for your environment. The recommendations here were built from working with customers one of two designs (listed below). Each data use case (e.g., batch processing, stream processing) aligns more closely to one of the two cluster designs, which we will call out in our recommendations. The first design is dynamic clusters that scale, or “churn”, a lot. These clusters run batch processing with Spark, or other workloads that create pods for a relatively short time but can vary greatly on the scale at any given time. These clusters create and delete resources like pods and nodes, or churn, at a high rate which adds unique pressures to Kubernetes and critical components.The other design is “static” clusters. These clusters are often large but have less volatile scaling behavior and are generally running longer-lived jobs, like streaming or training. Avoid interruptions for these workloads is a key concern and care must be taken when making changes. When we talk about large clusters or high rates of churn, it’s difficult to put a specific number to those phrases because of the complexity of kubernetes scalability. In general, these clusters have &gt;500 nodes and &gt;5000 pods, or are creating/destroying hundreds of resources a minute; however, the scalability constraints are different for every workload (even between two different Spark jobs).","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"AI/ML Platforms on EKS","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/data-on-eks/docs/blueprints/ai-ml","content":"AI/ML Platforms on EKS Running AI/ML platforms on Kubernetes can greatly simplify and automate the deployment, scaling, and management of these complex applications.

When more IP addresses are needed for your Pods, the CNI must communicate with EC2 APIs to assign the addresses to your nodes. During periods of high churn or large scale out these EC2 API calls can be rate throttled, which will delay the provisioning of Pods and thus delay the execution of workloads. When designing the VPC for your environment plan for more IP addresses than just your pods to accommodate this warm pool.  With the default VPC CNI configuration larger nodes will consume more IP addresses. For example a m5.8xlarge node that is running 10 pods will hold 60 IPs total (to satisfy WARM_ENI=1). However a m5.16xlarge node would hold 100 IPs. Configuring the VPC CNI to minimize this warm pool can increase the EC2 API calls from your nodes and increase the risk of rate throttling.

As the VPC CNI launches it tries to provision a Warm Pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to Kubernetes Pods (More details in the EKS Best Practices Guide).  The VPC CNI must make AWS EC2 API calls (like AssignPrivateIpV4Address and DescribeNetworkInterfaces) to assign those additional IPs and ENIs to the worker node. When the EKS cluster scales out the number of Nodes or Pods there could be a spike in the number of these EC2 API calls. This surge of calls could encounter rate throttling from the EC2 API to help the performance of the service, and to ensure fair usage for all Amazon EC2 customers. This rate throttling can cause the pool of IP address to be exhausted while the CNI tries to allocate more IPs.  These failures will cause errors like the one below, indicating that the provisioning of the container network namespace has failed because the VPC CNI could not provision an IP address.

To configure the --max-pods option you can update the userdata for your worker nodes to set this option via the --kubelet -extra-args in the bootstrap.sh script.

This means hard-coding a value for max-pods may cause problems if you change instance types or in mixed-instance environments.  In the EKS Optimized AMI releases there is a script included that can be used to help calculate the AWS Recommended max-pods value.

For example, you could extract features like loan-to-value ratio, borrower's credit score range, or loan origination year.  Step3: Divide the dataset into two parts: one for training the XGBoost model and one for evaluating its performance. This allows you to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  Step4: Feed the training dataset into XGBoost to train the model. XGBoost will analyze the loan attributes and their corresponding loan performance labels to learn the patterns and relationships between them. The objective is to predict whether a loan is likely to default or perform well based on the given features.  Step5: Once the model is trained, use the evaluation dataset to assess its performance. This involves analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to measure how well the model predicts loan performance  Step6: If the performance is not satisfactory, you can tune the XGBoost hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, tree depth, or regularization parameters, to improve the model's accuracy or address issues like overfitting.  Step7: Finally, with a trained and validated XGBoost model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen loan data. These predictions can help in identifying potential risks associated with loan default or evaluating loan performance.

The ability to monitor GPU usage in real-time, identify trends, and detect anomalies can significantly impact performance tuning, troubleshooting, and efficient resource utilization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator plays a key role in GPU observability. It automates the deployment of the necessary components to run GPU workloads on Kubernetes. One of its components, the DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) Exporter, is an open-source project that exports GPU metrics in a format that can be ingested by Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution. These metrics include GPU temperature, memory usage, GPU utilization, and more. The DCGM Exporter allows you to monitor these metrics on a per-GPU basis, providing granular visibility into your GPU resources.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator, in combination with the DCGM Exporter, exports GPU metrics to a Prometheus server. With its flexible query language, Prometheus allows you to slice and dice data to generate insights into resource usage patterns.  However, Prometheus is not designed for long-term data storage. This is where the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) comes into play. It provides a fully-managed, secure, and scalable service for Prometheus that makes it easy to analyze operational data at scale without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.  Visualizing these metrics and creating informative dashboards is where Grafana excels. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, offering rich visualizations to represent collected metrics intuitively. When combined with Prometheus, Grafana can display the GPU metrics collected by the DCGM Exporter in a user-friendly manner.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator is configured to export metrics to the Prometheus server, which then remote-writes these metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). As a user, you can log into the Grafana WebUI, deployed as part of the blueprint, and add AMP as a data source. Following this, you can import the open-source GPU monitoring dashboard that presents GPU metrics in an easily digestible format, facilitating real-time performance monitoring and resource optimization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator: Installed on your Kubernetes cluster, the NVIDIA GPU Operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of GPU resources. It deploys NVIDIA drivers and the DCGM Exporter on each GPU-equipped node.DCGM Exporter: The DCGM Exporter runs on each node, collecting GPU metrics and exposing them to Prometheus.Prometheus: Prometheus is a time-series database that collects metrics from various sources, including the DCGM Exporter. It pulls metrics from the exporter at regular intervals and stores them. In this setup, you would configure Prometheus to remote-write the collected metrics to AMP.Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP): AMP is a fully-managed Prometheus service provided by AWS. It takes care of long-term storage, scalability, and security of your Prometheus data.Grafana: Grafana is a visualization tool that can query AMP for the collected metrics, and display them on informative dashboards.  In this blueprint, we leverage DCGM to write GPU metrics to both Prometheus and Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). To verify the GPU metrics, you can use Grafana by running the following command:  kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n grafana `` Login to Grafana using `admin` as the username, and retrieve the password from Secrets Manager using the following AWS CLI command: ```bash aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id emr-spark-rapids-grafana --region us-west-2   Once logged in, add the AMP datasource to Grafana and import the Open Source GPU monitoring dashboard.

Step2: Copy WikiCorpus pre-training dataset for BERT model to FSx for Lustre filesystem​  In this step, we make it easy to transfer the WikiCorpus pre-training dataset, which is crucial for training the BERT model in distributed mode by multiple Trainium instances, to the FSx for Lustre filesystem. To achieve this, we will login to aws-cli-cmd-shell pod which includes an AWS CLI container, providing access to the filesystem.  Once you're inside the container, Copy the WikiCorpus dataset from S3 bucket (s3://neuron-s3/training_datasets/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar). The dataset is then unpacked, giving you access to its contents, ready for use in the subsequent BERT model pre-training process.  kubectl exec -i -t -n default aws-cli-cmd-shell -c app -- sh -c &quot;clear; (bash || ash || sh)&quot; # Once logged into the container yum install tar cd /data aws s3 cp s3://neuron-s3/training_datasets/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5/bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar . --no-sign-request chmod 744 bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar tar xvf bert_pretrain_wikicorpus_tokenized_hdf5_seqlen128.tar   Step3: Precompile the BERT graphs using neuron_parallel_compile​  PyTorch Neuron introduces a valuable tool known as neuron_parallel_compile, which significantly reduces graph compilation time by extracting model graphs and compiling them in parallel. This optimization technique expedites the process and results in faster model compilation. The compiled graphs are then stored on the Fsx for Lustre shared storage volume, accessible by worker nodes during model training. This efficient approach streamlines the training process and improves overall performance, making the most of PyTorch Neuron's capabilities.  Execute the following commands.This script prompts the user to configure their kubeconfig and verifies the presence of the lib folder with trn1_dist_ddp.py. It sets up Docker credentials, installs the TorchX client for Kubernetes. Using TorchX, the script runs a Kubernetes job to compile BERT graphs with optimized performance. Additionally, TorchX creates another Docker image and pushes it to the ECR repository within the same repo. This image is utilized in the subsequent pre-compiling pods, optimizing the overall BERT model training process.  cd ai-ml/trainium-inferentia/examples/dp-bert-large-pretrain chomd +x 2-bert-pretrain-precompile.sh ./2-bert-pretrain-precompile.sh   You can verify the pods status by running kubectl get pods or kubectl get vcjob. Successful output looks like below.    You can also verify the logs for the Pod once they are Succeeded. The precompilation job will run for ~15 minutes. Once complete, you will see the following in the output:  2023-07-29 09:42:42.000310: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Starting parallel compilations of the extracted graphs2023-07-29 09:42:42.000312: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Compiling /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.406_16969875447143373016.hlo.pb using following command: neuronx-cc compile —target=trn1 —framework XLA /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.406_16969875447143373016.hlo.pb —model-type=transformer —verbose=35 —output /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.406_16969875447143373016.neff 2023-07-29 09:42:42.000313: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Compiling /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.22250_9219523464496887986.hlo.pb using following command: neuronx-cc compile —target=trn1 —framework XLA /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.22250_9219523464496887986.hlo.pb —model-type=transformer —verbose=35 —output /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.22250_9219523464496887986.neff 2023-07-29 09:42:42.000314: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Compiling /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25434_3000743782456078279.hlo.pb using following command: neuronx-cc compile —target=trn1 —framework XLA /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25434_3000743782456078279.hlo.pb —model-type=transformer —verbose=35 —output /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25434_3000743782456078279.neff 2023-07-29 09:42:42.000315: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Compiling /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25637_13822314547392343350.hlo.pb using following command: neuronx-cc compile —target=trn1 —framework XLA /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25637_13822314547392343350.hlo.pb —model-type=transformer —verbose=35 —output /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.25637_13822314547392343350.neff 2023-07-29 09:42:42.000316: INFO ||PARALLEL_COMPILE||: Compiling /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.21907_15179678551789598088.hlo.pb using following command: neuronx-cc compile —target=trn1 —framework XLA /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.21907_15179678551789598088.hlo.pb —model-type=transformer —verbose=35 —output /tmp/parallel_compile_workdir/MODULE_SyncTensorsGraph.21907_15179678551789598088.neff ..... Compiler status PASS   New pre-training cache files are stored under FSx for Lustre.    Step4: Launch BERT pretraining job using 64 Neuron cores with two trn1.32xlarge instances​  We are now in the final step of training the BERT-large model with WikiCorpus data.  cd ai-ml/trainium-inferentia/examples/dp-bert-large-pretrain chomd +x 3-bert-pretrain.sh ./3-bert-pretrain.sh   Monitor the job with the following commands.

When deployed on Kubernetes, job schedulers can take advantage of the platform's features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability. Tools like Apache Airflow, Argo Workflow, and Amazon MWAA provide a simple and efficient way to manage and schedule jobs on a Kubernetes cluster. These tools are well-suited for a wide range of use cases, including data pipelines, machine learning workflows, and batch processing. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can simplify and automate the management of their job schedulers, freeing up resources to focus on other areas of the business. With its growing ecosystem of tools and support for a wide range of use cases, Kubernetes is becoming an increasingly popular choice for running job schedulers in production.

It defines a new Kubernetes resource called Cluster representing a PostgreSQL cluster made up of a single primary and an optional number of replicas that co-exist in a chosen Kubernetes namespace for High Availability and offloading of read-only queries.  Applications that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster can access the PostgreSQL database using a service which is solely managed by the operator, without having to worry about changes of the primary role following a failover or a switchover. Applications that reside outside the Kubernetes cluster, need to configure a Service or Ingress object to expose the Postgres via TCP. Web applications can take advantage of the native connection pooler based on PgBouncer.

Check examples folder for all kubernetes manifests.  Storage​  For running a highly scalable and durable self-managed PostgreSQL database on Kubernetes with Amazon EKS and EC2, it is recommended to use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes that provide high performance and fault tolerance. The preferred EBS volume types for this use case are:  1.Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 or io1):  Designed for I/O-intensive workloads such as databases.Offers consistent and low-latency performance.Allows you to provision a specific number of IOPS (input/output operations per second) according to your requirements.Provides up to 64,000 IOPS per volume and 1,000 MB/s throughput, making it suitable for demanding database workloads.  2.General Purpose SSD (gp3 or gp2):  Suitable for most workloads and offers a balance between performance and cost.Provides a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s throughput per volume, which can be increased if needed (up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s for gp3).Recommended for less I/O-intensive database workloads or when cost is a primary concern.  You can find both storageclass template in examples folder.  kubectl create -f examples/storageclass.yaml kubectl create -f examples/auth-prod.yaml   As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster you need to apply a configuration file that defines your desired Cluster.

Documentation will be updated once a deployment example has been added to the repository. Running streaming platforms on Kubernetes can provide a number of benefits for organizations looking to process and analyze real-time data streams. Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities to ensure high availability and reliability of streaming platforms. There are a number of popular streaming platforms that have emerged to support this use case, including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Pulsar. These platforms make it easy to process and analyze real-time data streams in a containerized environment, and provide features such as real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and fault-tolerance. By leveraging the power of Kubernetes, organizations can focus on building and processing their streaming data pipelines, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With its robust ecosystem of tools and support for a wide range of use cases, Kubernetes is becoming an increasingly popular choice for running streaming platforms in production.

A Trino cluster consists of a coordinator and many workers for parallel processing, which can be deployed as Kubernetes pods on an EKS cluster. The coordinator and the workers collaborate to access connected data sources, with schemas and references stored in a catalog.

First, port-forward your trino coordinator pod to access it locally:  COORDINATOR_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l &quot;app=trino,release=trino,component=coordinator&quot; -o name -n trino) kubectl port-forward $COORDINATOR_POD -n trino 8080:8080   While the port-forward is running, open another terminal tab where you have Trino CLI and run the following command to access the coordinator:  ./trino http://127.0.0.1:8080 --user admin   Once successful, you will be able to get a prompt to execute commands. You can use help command to see a list of supported commands.  For example:  To show a list of catalogs, run query - SHOW CATALOGS; and you can see hive and iceberg catalogs among others configured by the blueprint  Output​   Catalog --------- hive iceberg system tpcds tpch (5 rows) Query 20240215_200117_00003_6jdxw, FINISHED, 1 node Splits: 1 total, 1 done (100.00%) 0.49 [0 rows, 0B] [0 rows/s, 0B/s]   To see the schemas (databases) in Hive catalog, run query - SHOW SCHEMAS FROM hive; :  Output​   Schema -------------------- information_schema taxi_hive_database (2 rows)   Let's use taxi_hive_database and show table in this database -  USE hive.taxi_hive_database;   SHOW TABLES;   Output​  Table ------- hive (1 row)   Finally, to run a simple query to list items - SELECT * FROM hive LIMIT 5;  Output​  vendorid | tpep_pickup_datetime | tpep_dropoff_datetime | passenger_count | trip_distance | ratecodeid | store_and_fwd_flag | pulocationid | dolocation&gt; ----------+-------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+-----------&gt; 1 | 2022-09-01 00:28:12.000 | 2022-09-01 00:36:22.000 | 1.0 | 2.1 | 1.0 | N | 100 | 2&gt; 1 | 2022-11-01 00:24:49.000 | 2022-11-01 00:31:04.000 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | N | 158 | 1&gt; 1 | 2022-11-01 00:37:32.000 | 2022-11-01 00:42:23.000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 1.0 | N | 249 | 1&gt; 2 | 2022-09-01 00:02:24.000 | 2022-09-01 00:09:39.000 | 1.0 | 1.32 | 1.0 | N | 238 | 1&gt; 2 | 2022-09-01 00:47:25.000 | 2022-09-01 00:56:09.000 | 1.0 | 2.94 | 1.0 | N |   Cleaning Up Hive Resources​  Exit from Trino CLI with exit command.

Without fault-tolerant configuration, Trino query fails whenever any of the component tasks of the query fails due to any reason (for example, a worker node failure or termination). These failed queries have to be restarted from scratch resulting in longer execution time, compute wastage, and spend, especially for long-running queries.  When fault-tolerant execution is configured in Trino with a retry policy, intermediate exchange data is spooled in an external storage like Amazon S3 or HDFS using exchange manager. Trino then retries failed query (if retry policy is configured as &quot;QUERY&quot;) or failed tasks (if retry policy is configured as &quot;TASK&quot;). Trino's remaining workers reuse exchange manager data to retry and complete query in the event of a worker outage or other fault during query execution.  info A QUERY retry policy instructs Trino to retry whole query when an error occurs on a worker node. It is recommended to use this retry policy when the majority of the workload for the Trino cluster comprises many small queries. A TASK retry policy instructs Trino to retry individual tasks in the event of failure. It is recommended to use this policy when Trino executes large batch queries. The cluster can more efficiently retry smaller tasks within the query rather than retry the whole query.  This blueprint has deployed Trino cluster with fault-tolerant configuration with a TASK retry policy in config.properties file in coordinator and worker pods. Let's verify that by opening a bash command shell inside coordinator pod:  COORDINATOR_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l &quot;app=trino,release=trino,component=coordinator&quot; -o name -n trino) kubectl exec --stdin --tty $COORDINATOR_POD -n trino -- /bin/bash cat /etc/trino/config.properties   Output​  coordinator=true node-scheduler.include-coordinator=false http-server.http.port=8080 query.max-memory=40GB query.max-memory-per-node=4GB discovery.uri=http://localhost:8080 retry-policy=TASK exchange.compression-enabled=true query.low-memory-killer.delay=0s query.remote-task.max-error-duration=1m query.hash-partition-count=50   Blueprint has also configured exchange manager using an Amazon S3 bucket in exchange-manager.properties file in coordinator and worker pods. Let's also verify that inside coordinator pod  cat /etc/trino/exchange-manager.properties   Output​  exchange-manager.name=filesystem exchange.base-directories=s3://trino-exchange-bucket-20240215180855570800000004 exchange.s3.region=us-west-2 exchange.s3.iam-role=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:role/trino-sa-role   Please note down exchange manager S3 bucket name from above. You can explore contents of above S3 bucket in AWS Console. It will be empty when no query is running.  Now, let's exit from bash shell of the coordinator pod  exit   With below steps, we will now test fault-tolerant execution by running a select query and terminate few Trino workers when query is still running.  Let's create a trino_select_query_iceberg.sql file in the location where Trino CLI is installed and paste below SQL commands:  with inv as (select w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy ,stdev,mean, case mean when 0 then null else stdev/mean end cov from(select w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy ,stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) stdev,avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) mean from iceberg.iceberg_schema.inventory ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.item ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.warehouse ,iceberg.iceberg_schema.date_dim where inv_item_sk = i_item_sk and inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk and inv_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_year =1999 group by w_warehouse_name,w_warehouse_sk,i_item_sk,d_moy) foo where case mean when 0 then 0 else stdev/mean end &gt; 1) select inv1.w_warehouse_sk,inv1.i_item_sk,inv1.d_moy,inv1.mean, inv1.cov ,inv2.w_warehouse_sk,inv2.i_item_sk,inv2.d_moy,inv2.mean, inv2.cov from inv inv1,inv inv2 where inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk and inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk and inv1.d_moy=4 and inv2.d_moy=4+1 and inv1.cov &gt; 1.5 order by inv1.w_warehouse_sk,inv1.i_item_sk,inv1.d_moy,inv1.mean,inv1.cov,inv2.d_moy,inv2.mean, inv2.cov;   Let's now run select query first  export TRINO_UI_DNS=$(kubectl describe ingress --namespace=trino | grep Address: | awk '{ print &quot;http://&quot;$2 }') ./trino --file 'trino_select_query_iceberg.sql' --server ${TRINO_UI_DNS} --user admin --ignore-errors   Immediately after above command, when above query is still running, open another terminal and scale down worker pods to just 1 worker, terminating all other workers with command below:  kubectl scale deployment trino-worker -n trino --replicas=1   See Trino Web UI on browser and there is only 1 active worker running now as other workers are terminated:    Go to Amazon S3 console and verify intermediate exchange data spooling in exchange manager S3 bucket with a name starting with trino-exchange-bucket.    Let's now see Trino Web UI monitor again to verify completion of the query despite of 6 failed tasks due to terminated workers (we have encircled them in RED in the screenshot below).  info Please note, number of failed tasks could be different in your Trino Web UI depending upon how many tasks were running on workers that got terminated.

The examples showcases two data teams using namespaces emr-data-team-a and emr-data-team-b mapped to their EMR virtual clusters. You can use different Karpenter Nodepools for each team so that they can submit jobs that are unique to their workload. Teams can also use different storage requirements to run their Spark jobs. For example, you can use compute optimized Nodepool that has taints and specify tolerations using pod templates so that you can run spark on compute optimized EC2 instances. In terms of storage, you can decide whether to use EC2 instance-store or EBS or FSx for lustre volumes for data processing.

Since the lifecycle of EBS volumes is independent of Kafka brokers, if a broker fails and needs to be replaced, the EBS volume attached to the failed broker can be reattached to a replacement broker. Most of the replicated data for the replacement broker is already available in the EBS volume, and does not need to be copied over the network from another broker. This avoids most of the replication traffic required to bring the replacement broker up to speed with current operations.Just in time scale up: The characteristics of EBS volumes can be modified while they’re in use. Broker storage can be automatically scaled over time rather than provisioning storage for peak or adding additional brokers.Optimized for frequently-accessed-throughput-intensive workloads: Volume types such as st1 can be a good fit since these volumes are offered at a relatively low cost, support a large 1 MiB I/O block size, max IOPS of 500/volume, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB, and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.

This ensures that the Flink jobs are isolated and have their own resources.Use high-quality storage: Store Flink checkpoints and savepoints in high-quality storage such as Amazon S3 or another durable external storage. These storage options are reliable, scalable, and offer durability for large volumes of data.Optimize resource allocation: Allocate sufficient resources to Flink jobs to ensure optimal performance. This can be done by setting resource requests and limits for Flink containers.Proper network isolation: Use Kubernetes Network Policies to isolate Flink jobs from other workloads running on the same Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that Flink jobs have the required network access without being impacted by other workloads.Configure Flink optimally: Tune Flink settings according to your use case. For example, adjust Flink's parallelism settings to ensure that Flink jobs are scaled appropriately based on the size of the input data.Use checkpoints and savepoints: Use checkpoints for periodic snapshots of Flink application state and savepoints for more advanced use cases such as upgrading or downgrading the application.Store checkpoints and savepoints in the right places: Store checkpoints in distributed file systems or key-value stores like Amazon S3 or another durable external storage.

However, when it comes to maximizing the efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Llama-2, AWS Trn1/Inf2 instances shine as the optimal choice.  Scalability and AvailabilityOne of the key challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs) like Llama-2 is the scalability and availability of suitable hardware. Traditional GPU instances often face scarcity due to high demand, making it challenging to provision and scale resources effectively. In contrast, Trn1/Inf2 instances, such as trn1.32xlarge, trn1n.32xlarge, inf2.24xlarge and inf2.48xlarge, are purpose built for high-performance deep learning (DL) training and inference of generative AI models, including LLMs. They offer both scalability and availability, ensuring that you can deploy and scale your Llama-2 models as needed, without resource bottlenecks or delays.  Cost Optimization:Running LLMs on traditional GPU instances can be cost-prohibitive, especially given the scarcity of GPUs and their competitive pricing.Trn1/Inf2 instances provide a cost-effective alternative. By offering dedicated hardware optimized for AI and machine learning tasks, Trn1/Inf2 instances allow you to achieve top-notch performance at a fraction of the cost. This cost optimization enables you to allocate your budget efficiently, making LLM deployment accessible and sustainable.  Performance BoostWhile Llama-2 can achieve high-performance inference on GPUs, Neuron accelerators take performance to the next level. Neuron accelerators are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, providing hardware acceleration that significantly enhances Llama-2's inference speeds. This translates to faster response times and improved user experiences when deploying Llama-2 on Trn1/Inf2 instances.
